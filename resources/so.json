And I want to use jQuery in my extension. I am not using any background page, just a background script.\n\nHere are my files :\n\nmanifest.json\n\n{\n    \"manifest_version\": 2,\n\n    \"name\": \"Extension name\",\n    \"description\": \"This extension does something,\",\n    \"version\": \"0.1\",\n\n    \"permissions\": [\n        \"activeTab\"\n    ],\n\n    \"browser_action\": {\n        \"default_icon\": \"images/icon_128.png\"\n    },\n\n    \"background\": {\n        \"scripts\": [\"background.js\"],\n        \"persistent\": false\n    },\n\n    \"icons\": {\n        \"16\": \"images/icon_16.png\",\n        \"48\": \"images/icon_48.png\",\n        \"128\": \"images/icon_128.png\"\n    }\n}\n\nMy background.js file just runs another file named work.js\n\n// Respond to the click on extension Icon\nchrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function (tab) {\n    chrome.tabs.executeScript({\n        file: 'work.js'\n    });\n});\n\nThe main logic of my extension is inside work.js. The contents of which I don't think matters here for this question.\n\nWhat I want to ask is how can I use jQuery in my extension. Since I am not using any background page. I can't just add jQuery to it. So how can I add and use jQuery into my extension ?\n\nI tried running jQuery along with my work.js from background.js file.\n\n// Respond to the click on extension Icon\nchrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function (tab) {\n    chrome.tabs.executeScript({\n        file: 'thirdParty/jquery-2.0.3.js'\n    });\n    chrome.tabs.executeScript({\n        file: 'work.js'\n    });\n});\n\nAnd it works fine, but I am having the concern whether the scripts added to be executed in this manner are being executed asynchronously. If yes then it can happen that work.js runs even before jQuery (or other libraries which I may add in future).\n\nAnd I would also like to know what's the correct and best way to use third party libraries, in my chrome extension.\n    \n    \n        javascript jquery google-chrome asynchronous google-chrome-extension \n    \n    \n    \n    \nshare|edit|flag        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n        asked Jan 23 '14 at 19:22\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Ishan\n        \n            4681419\n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n        \n                \n\n    \n    \n\t    \n\t\t    \n                \n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                                1\n                        \n                        \n                                upvote\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                             \n                                \n                                    flag\n                                \n                        \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                The correct way is to go vanilla!\n                    – bjb568\n                Dec 25 '14 at 0:06\n                                                                            \n                    \n    \n                \n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t    \n\t    \n\n        \n\n                add a comment | \n            \n                 \n    \n              \n          \n          \n          \n            \n                start a bounty\n            \n          \n          \n          \n    \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Answer\n                                1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n        \n            active\n        \n            oldest\n        \n            votes\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n\n\n        \n        up vote\n        29\n        down vote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n            \n\n\n\n    \nYou have to add your jquery script to your chrome-extension project and to the background section of your manifest.json like this :\n\n  \"background\":\n    {\n        \"scripts\": [\"thirdParty/jquery-2.0.3.js\", \"background.js\"]\n    }\n\nIf you need jquery in a content_scripts, you have to add it in the manifest too:\n\n\"content_scripts\": \n    [\n        {\n            \"matches\":[\"http://website*\"],\n            \"js\":[\"thirdParty/jquery.1.10.2.min.js\", \"script.js\"],\n            \"css\": [\"css/style.css\"],\n            \"run_at\": \"document_end\"\n        }\n    ]\n\nThis is what I did.\n\nAlso, if I recall correctly, the background scripts are executed in a background window that you can open via chrome://extensions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \nshare|edit|flag                    \n    \n\n    \n        edited Jan 23 '14 at 19:34\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n            \n\n\n       \n       \n\n    \n    \n        answered Jan 23 '14 at 19:28\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Nico\n        \n            1,692922\n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n        \n        \n\n    \n    \n\t    \n\t\t    \n                \n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                                1\n                        \n                        \n                                upvote\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                             \n                                \n                                    flag\n                                \n                        \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Well what do you exactly mean by You have to add your jquery script to your chrome-extension project ? I did this :  manifest.json :   \"background\": {  `     \"scripts\": [\"thirdParty/jquery-2.0.3.js\", \"background.js\"],`  `           \"persistent\": false`  `            },`   and I have downloaded the jQuery to thirdParty folder. However I still can't use jQuery. It give the error : Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined   my added this to my work.js file for testing.  $(\"body\").html(\"Foo!\");\n                    – Ishan\n                Jan 24 '14 at 6:47\n                    \n                                                                            \n                    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                                  \n                        \n                        \n                                upvote\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                             \n                                \n                                    flag\n                                \n                        \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                The above comment looks like a mess but while adding comments preview is not shown.

And I want to use jQuery in my extension. I am not using any background page, just a background script.\n\nHere are my files :\n\nmanifest.json\n\n{\n    \"manifest_version\": 2,\n\n    \"name\": \"Extension name\",\n    \"description\": \"This extension does something,\",\n    \"version\": \"0.1\",\n\n    \"permissions\": [\n        \"activeTab\"\n    ],\n\n    \"browser_action\": {\n        \"default_icon\": \"images/icon_128.png\"\n    },\n\n    \"background\": {\n        \"scripts\": [\"background.js\"],\n        \"persistent\": false\n    },\n\n    \"icons\": {\n        \"16\": \"images/icon_16.png\",\n        \"48\": \"images/icon_48.png\",\n        \"128\": \"images/icon_128.png\"\n    }\n}\n\nMy background.js file just runs another file named work.js\n\n// Respond to the click on extension Icon\nchrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function (tab) {\n    chrome.tabs.executeScript({\n        file: 'work.js'\n    });\n});\n\nThe main logic of my extension is inside work.js. The contents of which I don't think matters here for this question.\n\nWhat I want to ask is how can I use jQuery in my extension. Since I am not using any background page. I can't just add jQuery to it. So how can I add and use jQuery into my extension ?\n\nI tried running jQuery along with my work.js from background.js file.\n\n// Respond to the click on extension Icon\nchrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function (tab) {\n    chrome.tabs.executeScript({\n        file: 'thirdParty/jquery-2.0.3.js'\n    });\n    chrome.tabs.executeScript({\n        file: 'work.js'\n    });\n});\n\nAnd it works fine, but I am having the concern whether the scripts added to be executed in this manner are being executed asynchronously. If yes then it can happen that work.js runs even before jQuery (or other libraries which I may add in future).\n\nAnd I would also like to know what's the correct and best way to use third party libraries, in my chrome extension.\n    \n    \n        javascript jquery google-chrome asynchronous google-chrome-extension \n    \n    \n    \n    \nshare|edit|flag        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n        asked Jan 23 '14 at 19:22\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Ishan\n        \n            4681419\n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n        \n                \n\n    \n    \n\t    \n\t\t    \n                \n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                                1\n                        \n                        \n                                upvote\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                             \n                                \n                                    flag\n                                \n                        \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                The correct way is to go vanilla!\n                    – bjb568\n                Dec 25 '14 at 0:06\n                                                                            \n                    \n    \n                \n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t    \n\t    \n\n        \n\n                add a comment | \n            \n                 \n    \n              \n          \n          \n          \n            \n                start a bounty\n            \n          \n          \n          \n    \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Answer\n                                1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n        \n            active\n        \n            oldest\n        \n            votes\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n\n\n        \n        up vote\n        29\n        down vote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n            \n\n\n\n    \nYou have to add your jquery script to your chrome-extension project and to the background section of your manifest.json like this :\n\n  \"background\":\n    {\n        \"scripts\": [\"thirdParty/jquery-2.0.3.js\", \"background.js\"]\n    }\n\nIf you need jquery in a content_scripts, you have to add it in the manifest too:\n\n\"content_scripts\": \n    [\n        {\n            \"matches\":[\"http://website*\"],\n            \"js\":[\"thirdParty/jquery.1.10.2.min.js\", \"script.js\"],\n            \"css\": [\"css/style.css\"],\n            \"run_at\": \"document_end\"\n        }\n    ]\n\nThis is what I did.\n\nAlso, if I recall correctly, the background scripts are executed in a background window that you can open via chrome://extensions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \nshare|edit|flag                    \n    \n\n    \n        edited Jan 23 '14 at 19:34\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n            \n\n\n       \n       \n\n    \n    \n        answered Jan 23 '14 at 19:28\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Nico\n        \n            1,692922\n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n        \n        \n\n    \n    \n\t    \n\t\t    \n                \n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                                1\n                        \n                        \n                                upvote\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                             \n                                \n                                    flag\n                                \n                        \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Well what do you exactly mean by You have to add your jquery script to your chrome-extension project ? I did this :  manifest.json :   \"background\": {  `     \"scripts\": [\"thirdParty/jquery-2.0.3.js\", \"background.js\"],`  `           \"persistent\": false`  `            },`   and I have downloaded the jQuery to thirdParty folder. However I still can't use jQuery. It give the error : Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined   my added this to my work.js file for testing.  $(\"body\").html(\"Foo!\");\n                    – Ishan\n                Jan 24 '14 at 6:47\n                    \n                                                                            \n                    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                                  \n                        \n                        \n                                upvote\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                             \n                                \n                                    flag\n                                \n                        \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                The above comment looks like a mess but while adding comments preview is not shown.

And I want to use jQuery in my extension. I am not using any background page, just a background script.\n\nHere are my files :\n\nmanifest.json\n\n{\n    \"manifest_version\": 2,\n\n    \"name\": \"Extension name\",\n    \"description\": \"This extension does something,\",\n    \"version\": \"0.1\",\n\n    \"permissions\": [\n        \"activeTab\"\n    ],\n\n    \"browser_action\": {\n        \"default_icon\": \"images/icon_128.png\"\n    },\n\n    \"background\": {\n        \"scripts\": [\"background.js\"],\n        \"persistent\": false\n    },\n\n    \"icons\": {\n        \"16\": \"images/icon_16.png\",\n        \"48\": \"images/icon_48.png\",\n        \"128\": \"images/icon_128.png\"\n    }\n}\n\nMy background.js file just runs another file named work.js\n\n// Respond to the click on extension Icon\nchrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function (tab) {\n    chrome.tabs.executeScript({\n        file: 'work.js'\n    });\n});\n\nThe main logic of my extension is inside work.js. The contents of which I don't think matters here for this question.\n\nWhat I want to ask is how can I use jQuery in my extension. Since I am not using any background page. I can't just add jQuery to it. So how can I add and use jQuery into my extension ?\n\nI tried running jQuery along with my work.js from background.js file.\n\n// Respond to the click on extension Icon\nchrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function (tab) {\n    chrome.tabs.executeScript({\n        file: 'thirdParty/jquery-2.0.3.js'\n    });\n    chrome.tabs.executeScript({\n        file: 'work.js'\n    });\n});\n\nAnd it works fine, but I am having the concern whether the scripts added to be executed in this manner are being executed asynchronously. If yes then it can happen that work.js runs even before jQuery (or other libraries which I may add in future).\n\nAnd I would also like to know what's the correct and best way to use third party libraries, in my chrome extension.\n    \n    \n        javascript jquery google-chrome asynchronous google-chrome-extension \n    \n    \n    \n    \nshare|edit|flag        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n        asked Jan 23 '14 at 19:22\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Ishan\n        \n            4681419\n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n        \n                \n\n    \n    \n\t    \n\t\t    \n                \n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                                1\n                        \n                        \n                                upvote\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                             \n                                \n                                    flag\n                                \n                        \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                The correct way is to go vanilla!\n                    – bjb568\n                Dec 25 '14 at 0:06\n                                                                            \n                    \n    \n                \n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t    \n\t    \n\n        \n\n                add a comment | \n            \n                 \n    \n              \n          \n          \n          \n            \n                start a bounty\n            \n          \n          \n          \n    \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Answer\n                                1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n        \n            active\n        \n            oldest\n        \n            votes\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n\n\n        \n        up vote\n        29\n        down vote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n            \n\n\n\n    \nYou have to add your jquery script to your chrome-extension project and to the background section of your manifest.json like this :\n\n  \"background\":\n    {\n        \"scripts\": [\"thirdParty/jquery-2.0.3.js\", \"background.js\"]\n    }\n\nIf you need jquery in a content_scripts, you have to add it in the manifest too:\n\n\"content_scripts\": \n    [\n        {\n            \"matches\":[\"http://website*\"],\n            \"js\":[\"thirdParty/jquery.1.10.2.min.js\", \"script.js\"],\n            \"css\": [\"css/style.css\"],\n            \"run_at\": \"document_end\"\n        }\n    ]\n\nThis is what I did.\n\nAlso, if I recall correctly, the background scripts are executed in a background window that you can open via chrome://extensions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \nshare|edit|flag                    \n    \n\n    \n        edited Jan 23 '14 at 19:34\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n            \n\n\n       \n       \n\n    \n    \n        answered Jan 23 '14 at 19:28\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Nico\n        \n            1,692922\n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n        \n        \n\n    \n    \n\t    \n\t\t    \n                \n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                                1\n                        \n                        \n                                upvote\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                             \n                                \n                                    flag\n                                \n                        \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Well what do you exactly mean by You have to add your jquery script to your chrome-extension project ? I did this :  manifest.json :   \"background\": {  `     \"scripts\": [\"thirdParty/jquery-2.0.3.js\", \"background.js\"],`  `           \"persistent\": false`  `            },`   and I have downloaded the jQuery to thirdParty folder. However I still can't use jQuery. It give the error : Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined   my added this to my work.js file for testing.  $(\"body\").html(\"Foo!\");\n                    – Ishan\n                Jan 24 '14 at 6:47\n                    \n                                                                            \n                    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                                  \n                        \n                        \n                                upvote\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                             \n                                \n                                    flag\n                                \n                        \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                The above comment looks like a mess but while adding comments preview is not shown.

      \n            \n\n\n    \n\nI am writing a chrome extension. And I want to use jQuery in my extension. I am not using any background page, just a background script.\n\nHere are my files :\n\nmanifest.json\n\n{\n    \"manifest_version\": 2,\n\n    \"name\": \"Extension name\",\n    \"description\": \"This extension does something,\",\n    \"version\": \"0.1\",\n\n    \"permissions\": [\n        \"activeTab\"\n    ],\n\n    \"browser_action\": {\n        \"default_icon\": \"images/icon_128.png\"\n    },\n\n    \"background\": {\n        \"scripts\": [\"background.js\"],\n        \"persistent\": false\n    },\n\n    \"icons\": {\n        \"16\": \"images/icon_16.png\",\n        \"48\": \"images/icon_48.png\",\n        \"128\": \"images/icon_128.png\"\n    }\n}\n\nMy background.js file just runs another file named work.js\n\n// Respond to the click on extension Icon\nchrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function (tab) {\n    chrome.tabs.executeScript({\n        file: 'work.js'\n    });\n});\n\nThe main logic of my extension is inside work.js. The contents of which I don't think matters here for this question.\n\nWhat I want to ask is how can I use jQuery in my extension. Since I am not using any background page. I can't just add jQuery to it. So how can I add and use jQuery into my extension ?\n\nI tried running jQuery along with my work.js from background.js file.\n\n// Respond to the click on extension Icon\nchrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function (tab) {\n    chrome.tabs.executeScript({\n        file: 'thirdParty/jquery-2.0.3.js'\n    });\n    chrome.tabs.executeScript({\n        file: 'work.js'\n    });\n});\n\nAnd it works fine, but I am having the concern whether the scripts added to be executed in this manner are being executed asynchronously. If yes then it can happen that work.js runs even before jQuery (or other libraries which I may add in future).\n\nAnd I would also like to know what's the correct and best way to use third party libraries, in my chrome extension.\n    \n    \n        javascript jquery google-chrome asynchronous google-chrome-extension \n    \n    \n    \n    \nshare|edit|flag        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n        asked Jan 23 '14 at 19:22\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Ishan\n        \n            4681419\n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n        \n                \n\n    \n    \n\t    \n\t\t    \n                \n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                                1\n                        \n                        \n                                upvote\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                             \n                                \n                                    flag\n                                \n                        \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                The correct way is to go vanilla!\n                    – bjb568\n                Dec 25 '14 at 0:06\n                                                                            \n                    \n    \n                \n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t    \n\t    \n\n        \n\n                add a comment | \n            \n                 \n    \n              \n          \n          \n          \n            \n                start a bounty\n            \n          \n          \n          \n    \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Answer\n                                1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n        \n            active\n        \n            oldest\n        \n            votes\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n\n\n        \n        up vote\n        29\n        down vote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n            \n\n\n\n    \nYou have to add your jquery script to your chrome-extension project and to the background section of your manifest.json like this :\n\n  \"background\":\n    {\n        \"scripts\": [\"thirdParty/jquery-2.0.3.js\", \"background.js\"]\n    }\n\nIf you need jquery in a content_scripts, you have to add it in the manifest too:\n\n\"content_scripts\": \n    [\n        {\n            \"matches\":[\"http://website*\"],\n            \"js\":[\"thirdParty/jquery.1.10.2.min.js\", \"script.js\"],\n            \"css\": [\"css/style.css\"],\n            \"run_at\": \"document_end\"\n        }\n    ]\n\nThis is what I did.\n\nAlso, if I recall correctly, the background scripts are executed in a background window that you can open via chrome://extensions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \nshare|edit|flag                    \n    \n\n    \n        edited Jan 23 '14 at 19:34\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n            \n\n\n       \n       \n\n    \n    \n        answered Jan 23 '14 at 19:28\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Nico\n        \n            1,692922\n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n        \n        \n\n    \n    \n\t    \n\t\t    \n                \n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                                1\n                        \n                        \n                                upvote\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                             \n                                \n                                    flag\n                                \n                        \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Well what do you exactly mean by You have to add your jquery script to your chrome-extension project ? I did this :  manifest.json :   \"background\": {  `     \"scripts\": [\"thirdParty/jquery-2.0.3.js\", \"background.js\"],`  `           \"persistent\": false`  `            },`   and I have downloaded the jQuery to thirdParty folder.

      \n            \n\n\n    \n\nI am writing a chrome extension. And I want to use jQuery in my extension. I am not using any background page, just a background script.\n\nHere are my files :\n\nmanifest.json\n\n{\n    \"manifest_version\": 2,\n\n    \"name\": \"Extension name\",\n    \"description\": \"This extension does something,\",\n    \"version\": \"0.1\",\n\n    \"permissions\": [\n        \"activeTab\"\n    ],\n\n    \"browser_action\": {\n        \"default_icon\": \"images/icon_128.png\"\n    },\n\n    \"background\": {\n        \"scripts\": [\"background.js\"],\n        \"persistent\": false\n    },\n\n    \"icons\": {\n        \"16\": \"images/icon_16.png\",\n        \"48\": \"images/icon_48.png\",\n        \"128\": \"images/icon_128.png\"\n    }\n}\n\nMy background.js file just runs another file named work.js\n\n// Respond to the click on extension Icon\nchrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function (tab) {\n    chrome.tabs.executeScript({\n        file: 'work.js'\n    });\n});\n\nThe main logic of my extension is inside work.js. The contents of which I don't think matters here for this question.\n\nWhat I want to ask is how can I use jQuery in my extension. Since I am not using any background page. I can't just add jQuery to it. So how can I add and use jQuery into my extension ?\n\nI tried running jQuery along with my work.js from background.js file.\n\n// Respond to the click on extension Icon\nchrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function (tab) {\n    chrome.tabs.executeScript({\n        file: 'thirdParty/jquery-2.0.3.js'\n    });\n    chrome.tabs.executeScript({\n        file: 'work.js'\n    });\n});\n\nAnd it works fine, but I am having the concern whether the scripts added to be executed in this manner are being executed asynchronously. If yes then it can happen that work.js runs even before jQuery (or other libraries which I may add in future).\n\nAnd I would also like to know what's the correct and best way to use third party libraries, in my chrome extension.\n    \n    \n        javascript jquery google-chrome asynchronous google-chrome-extension \n    \n    \n    \n    \nshare|edit|flag        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n        asked Jan 23 '14 at 19:22\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Ishan\n        \n            4681419\n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n        \n                \n\n    \n    \n\t    \n\t\t    \n                \n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                                1\n                        \n                        \n                                upvote\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                             \n                                \n                                    flag\n                                \n                        \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                The correct way is to go vanilla!\n                    – bjb568\n                Dec 25 '14 at 0:06\n                                                                            \n                    \n    \n                \n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t    \n\t    \n\n        \n\n                add a comment | \n            \n                 \n    \n              \n          \n          \n          \n            \n                start a bounty\n            \n          \n          \n          \n    \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Answer\n                                1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n        \n            active\n        \n            oldest\n        \n            votes\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n\n\n        \n        up vote\n        29\n        down vote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n            \n\n\n\n    \nYou have to add your jquery script to your chrome-extension project and to the background section of your manifest.json like this :\n\n  \"background\":\n    {\n        \"scripts\": [\"thirdParty/jquery-2.0.3.js\", \"background.js\"]\n    }\n\nIf you need jquery in a content_scripts, you have to add it in the manifest too:\n\n\"content_scripts\": \n    [\n        {\n            \"matches\":[\"http://website*\"],\n            \"js\":[\"thirdParty/jquery.1.10.2.min.js\", \"script.js\"],\n            \"css\": [\"css/style.css\"],\n            \"run_at\": \"document_end\"\n        }\n    ]\n\nThis is what I did.\n\nAlso, if I recall correctly, the background scripts are executed in a background window that you can open via chrome://extensions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \nshare|edit|flag                    \n    \n\n    \n        edited Jan 23 '14 at 19:34\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n            \n\n\n       \n       \n\n    \n    \n        answered Jan 23 '14 at 19:28\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Nico\n        \n            1,692922\n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n        \n        \n\n    \n    \n\t    \n\t\t    \n                \n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                                1\n                        \n                        \n                                upvote\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                             \n                                \n                                    flag\n                                \n                        \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Well what do you exactly mean by You have to add your jquery script to your chrome-extension project ?

      \n            \n\n\n    \n\nI am writing a chrome extension. And I want to use jQuery in my extension. I am not using any background page, just a background script.\n\nHere are my files :\n\nmanifest.json\n\n{\n    \"manifest_version\": 2,\n\n    \"name\": \"Extension name\",\n    \"description\": \"This extension does something,\",\n    \"version\": \"0.1\",\n\n    \"permissions\": [\n        \"activeTab\"\n    ],\n\n    \"browser_action\": {\n        \"default_icon\": \"images/icon_128.png\"\n    },\n\n    \"background\": {\n        \"scripts\": [\"background.js\"],\n        \"persistent\": false\n    },\n\n    \"icons\": {\n        \"16\": \"images/icon_16.png\",\n        \"48\": \"images/icon_48.png\",\n        \"128\": \"images/icon_128.png\"\n    }\n}\n\nMy background.js file just runs another file named work.js\n\n// Respond to the click on extension Icon\nchrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function (tab) {\n    chrome.tabs.executeScript({\n        file: 'work.js'\n    });\n});\n\nThe main logic of my extension is inside work.js. The contents of which I don't think matters here for this question.\n\nWhat I want to ask is how can I use jQuery in my extension. Since I am not using any background page. I can't just add jQuery to it. So how can I add and use jQuery into my extension ?\n\nI tried running jQuery along with my work.js from background.js file.\n\n// Respond to the click on extension Icon\nchrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function (tab) {\n    chrome.tabs.executeScript({\n        file: 'thirdParty/jquery-2.0.3.js'\n    });\n    chrome.tabs.executeScript({\n        file: 'work.js'\n    });\n});\n\nAnd it works fine, but I am having the concern whether the scripts added to be executed in this manner are being executed asynchronously. If yes then it can happen that work.js runs even before jQuery (or other libraries which I may add in future).\n\nAnd I would also like to know what's the correct and best way to use third party libraries, in my chrome extension.\n    \n    \n        javascript jquery google-chrome asynchronous google-chrome-extension \n    \n    \n    \n    \nshare|edit|flag        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n        asked Jan 23 '14 at 19:22\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Ishan\n        \n            4681419\n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n        \n                \n\n    \n    \n\t    \n\t\t    \n                \n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                                1\n                        \n                        \n                                upvote\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                             \n                                \n                                    flag\n                                \n                        \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                The correct way is to go vanilla!\n                    – bjb568\n                Dec 25 '14 at 0:06\n                                                                            \n                    \n    \n                \n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t    \n\t    \n\n        \n\n                add a comment | \n            \n                 \n    \n              \n          \n          \n          \n            \n                start a bounty\n            \n          \n          \n          \n    \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 Answer\n                                1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n        \n            active\n        \n            oldest\n        \n            votes\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n\n\n        \n        up vote\n        29\n        down vote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n            \n\n\n\n    \nYou have to add your jquery script to your chrome-extension project and to the background section of your manifest.json like this :\n\n  \"background\":\n    {\n        \"scripts\": [\"thirdParty/jquery-2.0.3.js\", \"background.js\"]\n    }\n\nIf you need jquery in a content_scripts, you have to add it in the manifest too:\n\n\"content_scripts\": \n    [\n        {\n            \"matches\":[\"http://website*\"],\n            \"js\":[\"thirdParty/jquery.1.10.2.min.js\", \"script.js\"],\n            \"css\": [\"css/style.css\"],\n            \"run_at\": \"document_end\"\n        }\n    ]\n\nThis is what I did.\n\nAlso, if I recall correctly, the background scripts are executed in a background window that you can open via chrome://extensions.\n    \n    \n    \n    \nshare|edit|flag                    \n    \n\n    \n        edited Jan 23 '14 at 19:34\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n            \n\n\n       \n       \n\n    \n    \n        answered Jan 23 '14 at 19:28\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        Nico\n        \n            1,692922\n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n        \n        \n\n    \n    \n\t    \n\t\t    \n                \n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                                1\n                        \n                        \n                                upvote\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                             \n                                \n                                    flag\n                                \n                        \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                Well what do you exactly mean by You have to add your jquery script to your chrome-extension project ?

\"scripts\": [\"thirdParty/jquery-2.0.3.js\", \"background.js\"]\n    }\n\nIf you need jquery in a content_scripts, you have to add it in the manifest too:\n\n\"content_scripts\": \n    [\n        {\n            \"matches\":[\"http://website*\"],\n            \"js\":[\"thirdParty/jquery.1.10.2.min.js\", \"script.js\"],\n            \"css\": [\"css/style.css\"],\n            \"run_at\": \"document_end\"\n        }\n    ]\n\nThis is what I did.\n\nAlso, if I recall correctly, the background scripts are executed in a background window that you can open via chrome://extensions.\n    \n

However I still can't use jQuery.
